# breast-cancer-prediction-model
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. I applied data preprocessing, trained a Random Forest model, and evaluated its performance. This project is part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning.
